### Well, hello! 👋

My full name is Whitney Hawk (yes, like the bird) Seiler, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm a full stack engineer with a passion for accessible web development and a background in nonprofits and public service. I believe that thoughtful, accessible technology is the foundation to a more equitable future, and I want to be a part of building that future!

I also have a personal goal of visiting every National Park in the US, and am currently working on a little side project to track my progress 🤫 🌲 🏔 🏕..

<b>Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations and opportunities:</b></br><pre>
